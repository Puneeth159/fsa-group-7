## About Application
 
 This is a game in which the player must follow a sequence of clues in order to locate the treasure. The first color on the left side gives the user a correct location to locate the treasure, while the second color on the right side confirms whether the user is in a valid location and, if not, gives the user a hint to get into one. If the treasure has been discovered, the user will be able to move on to the next level.
